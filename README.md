# Verday's Hytale Worldgen Additions
## Installation
In order to install this plugin, you will need to build it from source. After cloning the repository, run `./gradlew build`. This will produce a `.jar` file in `build/libs/`, simply place this file into your mods folder and restart your world/server. To get the Node Asset Editor to recognize the custom nodes added by this plugin, you will need to copy the provided node config directory from `src/main/resources/NodeEditor/` to your game's installation folder, specifically into `Hytale/install/release/package/game/latest/Client/NodeEditor/Workspaces/HytaleGenerator Java/`. After doing this, you should be able to start the Node Editor and see the custom nodes (under "Uncategorized").
